./src/commonjs -> OK
 - can set breakpoints and step in normally.
 - Everything works as expected.

./src/es-modules -> 
 - entry.js: breakpoint and stepping into `ViewEmitter.generateForecastData({});` has extra lines before actually getting into `generateForecastData()` function.
   - Steps into bundle file.
 - `debugger` statement hit and can step from there
   - Extra statements run when trying to step into `TestEmitter.showSectionRequest($scope, 'test');` before actually stepping into function (similar to entry.js)
